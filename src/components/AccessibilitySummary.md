- **Error Identification**: Improved error identification and suggestions for correction
- **Required Fields**: Clearly indicated required fields both visually and for screen readers
- **Form Instructions**: Added clear instructions for complex forms

## Interactive Components

- **Accessible Dialogs**: Enhanced modal dialogs with proper focus management and keyboard interaction
- **Dropdown Menus**: Improved dropdown menu accessibility with keyboard navigation
- **Data Tables**: Enhanced data tables with proper headers, captions, and summaries
- **Custom Components**: Ensured all custom components follow WAI-ARIA design patterns
- **Touch Targets**: Sized touch targets appropriately for mobile users (minimum 44x44px)

## Content and Structure

- **Headings**: Used proper heading hierarchy for better document structure
- **Landmarks**: Implemented ARIA landmarks for major sections of the page
- **Language**: Set appropriate language attributes for content
- **Page Titles**: Added descriptive and unique page titles
- **Link Text**: Ensured all links have descriptive text that makes sense out of context

## Testing and Compliance

- **Automated Testing**: Implemented automated accessibility testing in the CI/CD pipeline
- **Manual Testing**: Conducted manual testing with keyboard navigation and screen readers
- **WCAG 2.1 AA**: Verified compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria
- **Accessibility Statement**: Created an accessibility statement documenting compliance efforts
- **Continuous Improvement**: Established a process for ongoing accessibility improvements

## Implementation Details

### AccessibilityContext

Created a React context to manage accessibility features:

```tsx
// Provides screen reader announcements and focus management
const AccessibilityContext = createContext({
  announceToScreenReader: (message: string, politeness?: 'polite' | 'assertive') => {},
  focusElement: (elementId: string) => {},
  registerSkipTarget: (id: string, label: string) => {},
});
```

### Accessible Components

Enhanced components with accessibility features:

- **AccessibleForm**: Form component with built-in validation and screen reader announcements
- **FocusTrap**: Component to trap focus within modals and dialogs
- **SkipLink**: Component to allow keyboard users to skip to main content
- **ScreenReaderText**: Component for text visible only to screen readers
- **KeyboardNavigation**: Utility for managing keyboard navigation in complex components
